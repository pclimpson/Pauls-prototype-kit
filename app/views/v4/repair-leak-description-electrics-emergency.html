      <p>An emergency repair is when there's immediate danger to you or the structure of the building. In an emergency we'll make the situation safe; we may need to return another day to complete the full repair.</p>

      <p>All emergency repairs can be reported 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by calling <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">0800 952 4444</span> or <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">020 7525 2600</span>. You may experience longer waiting times due to a high volume of calls.</p>
